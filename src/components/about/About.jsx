        <h3>web developer located in Argentina üìç.</h3>
        <p>
          As a junior web developer with solid knowledge of cutting-edge
          technologies. I am passionate about the world of web development and I
          specialize in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and
          Next.js for the frontend. Additionally, I also have experience in
          backend development using MongoDB, Express, MySQL and Node.js. Since I
          discovered my passion for web development, I have been working hard to
          improve my skills and learn new technologies. I consider myself a
          self-taught person and I am always looking for new challenges to
          expand my knowledge.
